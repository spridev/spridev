### Welcome 🐝

I'm Joé, a software engineer based in Fribourg, Switzerland.

Visit my portfolio to find out more about my projects: **[spri.dev](https://spri.dev)**

My go-to tech stack will vary depending on the project's requirements. However, here are a few technologies that I particularly enjoy working with:

- 👨‍💻 Languages: TypeScript, Java, Python
- ⚛ Web Frameworks: React (w/wo Next.js), Vue.js
- 💅 CSS Frameworks: Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Code style: ESLint & Prettier
- 🧰 Tools: Turborepo, Docker, GitHub CI/CD, AWS...

Most of my projects are either hosted on GitLab or kept as closed-source, so don't expect to find many interesting projects here.
